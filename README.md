This project is developed using Unity and incorporates the A* pathfinding algorithm within its own 3D grid system. Data pooling has been applied for high optimization. To further enhance performance, consider implementing the Jobs system for parallelization and optimizing the code. Introducing the ECS (Entity Component System) could lead to even greater optimization. Additionally, taking the time to write cleaner code would be beneficial, keeping in mind that the current implementation was completed in just two days.
